Below is a single copy-paste developer prompt / specification you can give to an AI code generator, contractor, or use as a high-level project brief. It contains concrete package names, API example, architecture, features, UX notes, data models, and non-functional requirements.

Prompt / Project Spec — “QuizChamp” (Flutter quiz app — BLoC + DI, target 13+)

Goal: Build a Flutter quiz app for users 13+ with Google-only auth, single-source-of-truth BLoC architecture, dependency injection, quizzes from a free API, animations (Lottie + custom), profile & progress tracking, friends/leagues/leaderboards, points & hearts (lives), push notifications + wakelock during quizzes, AdMob & in-app purchases for hearts, subscription tier handling, sounds, and polished UX.

High-level requirements

Framework: Flutter (mobile: Android & iOS)

State management: BLoC (single source of truth; use bloc + flutter_bloc). 
Dart packages

Dependency injection: get_it (+ optional codegen). 
Dart packages

Auth: Google Sign-In (google_sign_in plugin). Only Google login supported. 
Dart packages

Free Questions API: Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB) — free JSON API, no API key required. Example request included below. 
opentdb.com

Ads: Google AdMob via google_mobile_ads. 
Dart packages

In-App Purchases: use in_app_purchase (native store purchases/subscriptions).

Animations: Lottie for animations; smooth custom Flutter animations for question transitions.

Sound: audioplayers or just_audio for SFX and short music loops.

Wake Lock: use wakelock plugin to keep screen awake during active quizzes.

Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (or another push provider) for reminders/league invites.

Target audience: 13+ — ensure no collection of sensitive child data; minimal profile info (display name, avatar optional), parental consent guidance in privacy policy.

Accessibility: text scaling, clear contrast, touch target sizes.

Example OpenTDB usage (free API)

Base: https://opentdb.com/api.php

Example: Get 10 mixed questions (multiple choice):
https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=multiple

Use category & difficulty query params as needed. (API returns question, correct_answer, incorrect_answers.)

Core features (detailed)

Auth

Google-only sign in.

Minimal account: uid, displayName, email, photoUrl (optional).

Local cache of user session + secure token storage.

Quiz Engine

Fetch quizzes from OpenTDB with local caching.

Question timer, per-question animations, feedback animations (Lottie).

Lifelines/hearts: each quiz attempt uses hearts; when hearts depleted, user can buy hearts (IAP) or wait to regenerate.

Sounds for correct/wrong/timeout + optional mute toggle.

Profile & Progress

Track stats: total quizzes, accuracy, streaks, levels, XP/points.

Visual progress graph & badges.

Sync with backend (cloud DB) for cross-device progress.

Friends, Leagues & Leaderboards

Friends: invite by Google contacts link (or share link). Friend list, friend vs friend challenge.

Leagues: seasonal leagues (e.g., weekly), match players into leagues by skill/points.

Leaderboards: global, friends, league; daily/weekly/monthly.

Points awarding rules (e.g., +100 for correct, bonus for streaks).

Currency & Monetization

Points: earned by correct answers; visible in profile.

Hearts/Lives: consumed per attempt or per life in rounds. Buy via IAP (consumable).

Subscription: monthly subscription removes ads, grants daily hearts, exclusive leagues.

In-app purchase handling: use native stores (Google Play / App Store); handle receipts and subscription status server-side where possible.

Ads

AdMob banners on non-paying screens, rewarded ads to earn hearts, interstitial after rounds.

Respect subscription status to disable ads.

Notifications & WakeLock

Push notifications for friend invites, league results, reminders.

WakeLock while an active timed quiz is running (so screen stays on during question answering).

Respect power/battery settings — allow user to disable wake lock.

UI / Animation

Use Lottie animations for onboarding, correct/wrong animations, level up.

Smooth card flip / slide animations while changing questions.

Sounds for UX actions; global mute toggle.

Age 13+ & Privacy

Consent/Privacy: state app for 13+ only; do not collect birthdate or other child-sensitive info.

Privacy policy must describe data collected (analytics, push tokens, Google id) and use.

Architecture & technical design (strict)

Layers: Presentation (BLoC), Domain (use cases), Data (repositories, remote/local data sources).

Single Source of Truth: Repositories return canonical data sources (local cache first, then remote), and BLoCs subscribe to repository streams. Use Stream/Cubit for state updates.

DI: get_it to register singletons: ApiClient, Repositories, BLoCs, LocalStorage, NotificationService.

Networking: dio (or http) for flexible requests, interceptors for logging & retry.

Local storage: hive or sembast for caching questions, user progress, offline leaderboards.

Backend (optional but recommended):

Minimal backend to store leaderboards, subscriptions, purchases receipts, friend relationships, league logic and to verify IAP receipts. Use Firebase (Firestore + Cloud Functions) or a simple Node/Express API with a managed DB.

Push: Firebase Cloud Messaging + token stored in backend for sending invites & reminders.

Packages (recommended)

(Use latest versions on pub.dev in code)

bloc, flutter_bloc (BLoC pattern). 
Dart packages

get_it (+ get_it_injector_gen optional). 
Dart packages

google_sign_in (Google auth). 
Dart packages

google_mobile_ads (AdMob). 
Dart packages

in_app_purchase (IAP/subscriptions). 
Dart packages

lottie (Lottie animations). 
Dart packages

wakelock / wakelock_plus (keep screen awake). 
Dart packages

audioplayers / just_audio (SFX).

dio (HTTP client) + retrofit (optional).

hive (local cache) or sqflite.

firebase_messaging, cloud_firestore if using Firebase backend.

Data models (examples)

User

id (string), displayName, email, photoUrl, points (int), subscriptionStatus, hearts (int), createdAt

Question

id, category, type (multiple/boolean), difficulty, questionText, answers[], correctAnswer

QuizAttempt

id, userId, questions[], correctCount, startAt, endAt, pointsEarned

League

id, name, season, memberIds[], leaderboard[]

BLoC / Cubit structure (suggested)

AuthBloc — sign in/out, session state

QuizBloc — current quiz state, timer, question index, scoring

ProfileBloc — user profile + stats

FriendsBloc — friends list, invites

LeaguesBloc — current leagues, standings

LeaderboardBloc — fetch & refresh leaderboards

PurchaseBloc — handles IAP result flow & subscription state

Each bloc reads/writes to corresponding repository (e.g., QuizRepository, UserRepository) registered in get_it.

Offline / Caching behavior

Cache recent question sets for quick retry & offline quizzes.

Persist progress and pending purchases (to reconcile with store on next network).

Leaderboards can use eventual consistency; show cached view while refreshing.

IAP & Subscription handling

Implement consumable purchases for hearts via in_app_purchase.

Implement non-consumable or subscription product for ad removal + monthly hearts.

Validate receipts server-side where possible, and store subscription state server-side.

Handle edge cases: restored purchases, network failures, user cancels.

Testing & QA

Unit tests for BLoCs + repositories.

Integration tests for flows (login, purchase, quiz round).

Test ad flows + rewarded video earning hearts.

Test subscription lifecycle: purchase, expiration, restore.

Analytics & crash reporting

Use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics (or equivalent).

Track events: quiz_started, quiz_completed, friend_invite_sent, purchase_made, ad_reward_claimed.

Security & compliance

Do not store OAuth refresh tokens insecurely.

If collecting analytics/push tokens, disclose in privacy policy.

Age 13+ only: include UI text “For users 13+” and request parental consent in privacy policy if app expands to younger audiences.

UX / Onboarding suggestions

Short onboarding that highlights hearts, subscription benefits, and friend features.

First-run tutorial showing quiz mechanics and rewarded ads to get extra hearts.

Lottie success animation on level up.

Deliverables (minimal MVP)

Auth with Google sign in.

Quiz screen with timer + Lottie animations + sounds; questions from OpenTDB.

Profile + progress persistence.

Hearts system with consumable IAP purchase and rewarded ads.

Leaderboard (global & friends) with basic backend or Firebase.

Push notifications, wake lock during active question.

AdMob integration + subscription to remove ads.

CI/CD setup for Android/iOS builds and store submission checklist.

Example API call and mapping (concrete)

Request: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=multiple

Map response to Question model; shuffle correct + incorrect answers into answers[].

Example BLoC flow: StartQuizEvent -> repository fetch questions -> emit QuizLoadedState(questions) -> AnswerSelectedEvent -> evaluate + emit QuestionAnsweredState.

Notes / Risks & next steps

LinkedIn post content couldn’t be fetched because LinkedIn requires login; use the spec above as full recreation of a quiz app with similar capabilities. If you want me to match exact visuals from that post, upload screenshots or give the copy/paste content and I’ll tailor UI and copy to match.

For production subscription receipt validation and secure leaderboards, a small backend (Firebase or simple server) is strongly recommended.

If you want, I can now:

(A) generate a pubspec.yaml + starter folder structure following this spec, or

(B) write one or two example BLoC classes (e.g., AuthBloc, QuizBloc) + repository interfaces, or

(C) produce a feature backlog + sprint plan (MVP → v1 → v2) with estimated tasks.
